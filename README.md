# CoastFIRE
Calculate how close you are to Financial Independence

This project allows a user to specify key factors around retirement savings in order to measure how close they are to reaching the escape velocity needed to allow the assets to grow on their own rather than relying on savings.

Variables that can be manipulated include:
 - Current Age
 - Retirement Age
 - Age of Expiry
 - Desired Annual Income in Today's Dollars
 - Nominal Return During Accumulation
 - Nominal Return during Retirement
 - Inflation Rate

Default values of the above variables will be provided if not specified.
